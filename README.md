### 💡 4D ArXiv Papers

#### 1. AR4D: Autoregressive 4D Generation from Monocular Videos
Hanxin Zhu, Tianyu He, Xiqian Yu, Junliang Guo, Zhibo Chen, Jiang Bian (University of Science and Technology of China, Microsoft Research Asia)
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Recent advancements in generative models have ignited substantial interest in dynamic 3D content creation (\ie, 4D generation). Existing approaches primarily rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to infer novel-view videos, typically leading to issues such as limited diversity, spatial-temporal inconsistency and poor prompt alignment, due to the inherent randomness of SDS. To tackle these problems, we propose AR4D, a novel paradigm for SDS-free 4D generation. Specifically, our paradigm consists of three stages. To begin with, for a monocular video that is either generated or captured, we first utilize pre-trained expert models to create a 3D representation of the first frame, which is further fine-tuned to serve as the canonical space. Subsequently, motivated by the fact that videos happen naturally in an autoregressive manner, we propose to generate each frame's 3D representation based on its previous frame's representation, as this autoregressive generation manner can facilitate more accurate geometry and motion estimation. Meanwhile, to prevent overfitting during this process, we introduce a progressive view sampling strategy, utilizing priors from pre-trained large-scale 3D reconstruction models. To avoid appearance drift introduced by autoregressive generation, we further incorporate a refinement stage based on a global deformation field and the geometry of each frame's 3D representation. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that AR4D can achieve state-of-the-art 4D generation without SDS, delivering greater diversity, improved spatial-temporal consistency, and better alignment with input prompts.

<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
4D video control is essential in video generation as it enables the use of sophisticated lens techniques, such as multi-camera shooting and dolly zoom, which are currently unsupported by existing methods. Training a video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly to control 4D content requires expensive multi-view videos. Inspired by Monocular Dynamic novel View Synthesis (MDVS) that optimizes a 4D representation and renders videos according to different 4D elements, such as camera pose and object motion editing, we bring pseudo 4D Gaussian fields to video generation. Specifically, we propose a novel framework that constructs a pseudo 4D Gaussian field with dense 3D point tracking and renders the Gaussian field for all video frames. Then we finetune a pretrained DiT to generate videos following the guidance of the rendered video, dubbed as GS-DiT. To boost the training of the GS-DiT, we also propose an efficient Dense 3D Point Tracking (D3D-PT) method for the pseudo 4D Gaussian field construction. Our D3D-PT outperforms SpatialTracker, the state-of-the-art sparse 3D point tracking method, in accuracy and accelerates the inference speed by two orders of magnitude. During the inference stage, GS-DiT can generate videos with the same dynamic content while adhering to different camera parameters, addressing a significant limitation of current video generation models. GS-DiT demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and extends the 4D controllability of Gaussian splatting to video generation beyond just camera poses. It supports advanced cinematic effects through the manipulation of the Gaussian field and camera intrinsics, making it a powerful tool for creative video production.

## Text to Video

### 💡 T2V ArXiv Papers

#### 1. TransPixar: Advancing Text-to-Video Generation with Transparency

<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Text-to-video generative models have made significant strides, enabling diverse applications in entertainment, advertising, and education. However, generating RGBA video, which includes alpha channels for transparency, remains a challenge due to limited datasets and the difficulty of adapting existing models. Alpha channels are crucial for visual effects (VFX), allowing transparent elements like smoke and reflections to blend seamlessly into scenes. We introduce TransPixar, a method to extend pretrained video models for RGBA generation while retaining the original RGB capabilities. TransPixar leverages a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, incorporating alpha-specific tokens and using LoRA-based fine-tuning to jointly generate RGB and alpha channels with high consistency. By optimizing attention mechanisms, TransPixar preserves the strengths of the original RGB model and achieves strong alignment between RGB and alpha channels despite limited training data. Our approach effectively generates diverse and consistent RGBA videos, advancing the possibilities for VFX and interactive content creation.

<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Video personalization methods allow us to synthesize videos with specific concepts such as people, pets, and places. However, existing methods often focus on limited domains, require time-consuming optimization per subject, or support only a single subject. We present Video Alchemist − a video model with built-in multi-subject, open-set personalization capabilities for both foreground objects and background, eliminating the need for time-consuming test-time optimization. Our model is built on a new Diffusion Transformer module that fuses each conditional reference image and its corresponding subject-level text prompt with cross-attention layers. Developing such a large model presents two main challenges: dataset and evaluation. First, as paired datasets of reference images and videos are extremely hard to collect, we sample selected video frames as reference images and synthesize a clip of the target video. However, while models can easily denoise training videos given reference frames, they fail to generalize to new contexts. To mitigate this issue, we design a new automatic data construction pipeline with extensive image augmentations. Second, evaluating open-set video personalization is a challenge in itself. To address this, we introduce a personalization benchmark that focuses on accurate subject fidelity and supports diverse personalization scenarios. Finally, our extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing personalization methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Existing video generation models struggle to follow complex text prompts and synthesize multiple objects, raising the need for additional grounding input for improved controllability. In this work, we propose to decompose videos into visual primitives - blob video representation, a general representation for controllable video generation. Based on blob conditions, we develop a blob-grounded video diffusion model named BlobGEN-Vid that allows users to control object motions and fine-grained object appearance. In particular, we introduce a masked 3D attention module that effectively improves regional consistency across frames. In addition, we introduce a learnable module to interpolate text embeddings so that users can control semantics in specific frames and obtain smooth object transitions. We show that our framework is model-agnostic and build BlobGEN-Vid based on both U-Net and DiT-based video diffusion models. Extensive experimental results show that BlobGEN-Vid achieves superior zero-shot video generation ability and state-of-the-art layout controllability on multiple benchmarks. When combined with an LLM for layout planning, our framework even outperforms proprietary text-to-video generators in terms of compositional accuracy.

<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
The quality of video-text pairs fundamentally determines the upper bound of text-to-video models. Currently, the datasets used for training these models suffer from significant shortcomings, including low temporal consistency, poor-quality captions, substandard video quality, and imbalanced data distribution. The prevailing video curation process, which depends on image models for tagging and manual rule-based curation, leads to a high computational load and leaves behind unclean data. As a result, there is a lack of appropriate training datasets for text-to-video models. To address this problem, we present VidGen-1M, a superior training dataset for text-to-video models. Produced through a coarse-to-fine curation strategy, this dataset guarantees high-quality videos and detailed captions with excellent temporal consistency. When used to train the video generation model, this dataset has led to experimental results that surpass those obtained with other models.

## Text to Scene

### 💡 3D Scene ArXiv Papers

#### 1. LAYOUTDREAMER: Physics-guided Layout for Text-to-3D Compositional Scene Generation
Yang Zhou, Zongjin He, Qixuan Li, Chao Wang (ShangHai University)
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Recently, the field of text-guided 3D scene generation has garnered significant attention. High-quality generation that aligns with physical realism and high controllability is crucial for practical 3D scene applications. However, existing methods face fundamental limitations: (i) difficulty capturing complex relationships between multiple objects described in the text, (ii) inability to generate physically plausible scene layouts, and (iii) lack of controllability and extensibility in compositional scenes. In this paper, we introduce LayoutDreamer, a framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to facilitate high-quality, physically consistent compositional scene generation guided by text. Specifically, given a text prompt, we convert it into a directed scene graph and adaptively adjust the density and layout of the initial compositional 3D Gaussians. Subsequently, dynamic camera adjustments are made based on the training focal point to ensure entity-level generation quality. Finally, by extracting directed dependencies from the scene graph, we tailor physical and layout energy to ensure both realism and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LayoutDreamer outperforms other compositional scene generation quality and semantic alignment methods. Specifically, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the multiple objects generation metric of T3Bench.

## Text to Human Motion

### 💡 Motion ArXiv Papers

#### 1. MotionLab: Unified Human Motion Generation and Editing via the Motion-Condition-Motion Paradigm
Ziyan Guo, Zeyu Hu, Na Zhao, De Wen Soh 

(Singapore University of Technology and Design, LightSpeed Studios)
<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Human motion generation and editing are key components of computer graphics and vision. However, current approaches in this field tend to offer isolated solutions tailored to specific tasks, which can be inefficient and impractical for real-world applications. While some efforts have aimed to unify motion-related tasks, these methods simply use different modalities as conditions to guide motion generation. Consequently, they lack editing capabilities, fine-grained control, and fail to facilitate knowledge sharing across tasks. To address these limitations and provide a versatile, unified framework capable of handling both human motion generation and editing, we introduce a novel paradigm: Motion-Condition-Motion, which enables the unified formulation of diverse tasks with three concepts: source motion, condition, and target motion. Based on this paradigm, we propose a unified framework, MotionLab, which incorporates rectified flows to learn the mapping from source motion to target motion, guided by the specified conditions. In MotionLab, we introduce the 1) MotionFlow Transformer to enhance conditional generation and editing without task-specific modules; 2) Aligned Rotational Position Encoding} to guarantee the time synchronization between source motion and target motion; 3) Task Specified Instruction Modulation; and 4) Motion Curriculum Learning for effective multi-task learning and knowledge sharing across tasks. Notably, our MotionLab demonstrates promising generalization capabilities and inference efficiency across multiple benchmarks for human motion.

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
There is a growing demand for customized and expressive 3D characters with the emergence of AI agents and Metaverse, but creating 3D characters using traditional computer graphics tools is a complex and time-consuming task. To address these challenges, we propose a user-friendly framework named Make-A-Character (Mach) to create lifelike 3D avatars from text descriptions. The framework leverages the power of large language and vision models for textual intention understanding and intermediate image generation, followed by a series of human-oriented visual perception and 3D generation modules. Our system offers an intuitive approach for users to craft controllable, realistic, fully-realized 3D characters that meet their expectations within 2 minutes, while also enabling easy integration with existing CG pipeline for dynamic expressiveness.

#### 2. InstructHumans: Editing Animated 3D Human Textures with Instructions (text to 3d human texture editing)

<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
We present InstructHumans, a novel framework for instruction-driven 3D human texture editing. Existing text-based editing methods use Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to distill guidance from generative models. This work shows that naively using such scores is harmful to editing as they destroy consistency with the source avatar. Instead, we propose an alternate SDS for Editing (SDS-E) that selectively incorporates subterms of SDS across diffusion timesteps. We further enhance SDS-E with spatial smoothness regularization and gradient-based viewpoint sampling to achieve high-quality edits with sharp and high-fidelity detailing. InstructHumans significantly outperforms existing 3D editing methods, consistent with the initial avatar while faithful to the textual instructions.

<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
This paper aims to generate physically-layered 3D humans from text prompts. Existing methods either generate 3D clothed humans as a whole or support only tight and simple clothing generation, which limits their applications to virtual try-on and part-level editing. To achieve physically-layered 3D human generation with reusable and complex clothing, we propose a novel layer-wise dressed human representation based on a physically-decoupled diffusion model. Specifically, to achieve layer-wise clothing generation, we propose a dual-representation decoupling framework for generating clothing decoupled from the human body, in conjunction with an innovative multi-layer fusion volume rendering method. To match the clothing with different body shapes, we propose an SMPL-driven implicit field deformation network that enables the free transfer and reuse of clothing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art layered 3D human generation with complex clothing but also supports virtual try-on and layered human animation.

<details span>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
We present DreamHOI, a novel method for zero-shot synthesis of human-object interactions (HOIs), enabling a 3D human model to realistically interact with any given object based on a textual description. This task is complicated by the varying categories and geometries of real-world objects and the scarcity of datasets encompassing diverse HOIs. To circumvent the need for extensive data, we leverage text-to-image diffusion models trained on billions of image-caption pairs. We optimize the articulation of a skinned human mesh using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) gradients obtained from these models, which predict image-space edits. However, directly backpropagating image-space gradients into complex articulation parameters is ineffective due to the local nature of such gradients. To overcome this, we introduce a dual implicit-explicit representation of a skinned mesh, combining (implicit) neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with (explicit) skeleton-driven mesh articulation. During optimization, we transition between implicit and explicit forms, grounding the NeRF generation while refining the mesh articulation. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating realistic HOIs.

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Generating animatable human avatars from a single image is essential for various digital human modeling applications. Existing 3D reconstruction methods often struggle to capture fine details in animatable models, while generative approaches for controllable animation, though avoiding explicit 3D modeling, suffer from viewpoint inconsistencies in extreme poses and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging the power of generative models to produce detailed multi-view canonical pose images, which help resolve ambiguities in animatable human reconstruction. We then propose a robust method for 3D reconstruction of inconsistent images, enabling real-time rendering during inference. Specifically, we adapt a transformer-based video generation model to generate multi-view canonical pose images and normal maps, pretraining on a large-scale video dataset to improve generalization. To handle view inconsistencies, we recast the reconstruction problem as a 4D task and introduce an efficient 3D modeling approach using 4D Gaussian Splatting. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves photorealistic, real-time animation of 3D human avatars from in-the-wild images, showcasing its effectiveness and generalization capability.

<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
Reconstructing high-fidelity 3D head avatars is crucial in various applications such as virtual reality. The pioneering methods reconstruct realistic head avatars with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), which have been limited by training and rendering speed. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) significantly improve the efficiency of training and rendering. However, the surface inconsistency of 3DGS results in subpar geometric accuracy; later, 2DGS uses 2D surfels to enhance geometric accuracy at the expense of rendering fidelity. To leverage the benefits of both 2DGS and 3DGS, we propose a novel method named MixedGaussianAvatar for realistically and geometrically accurate head avatar reconstruction. Our main idea is to utilize 2D Gaussians to reconstruct the surface of the 3D head, ensuring geometric accuracy. We attach the 2D Gaussians to the triangular mesh of the FLAME model and connect additional 3D Gaussians to those 2D Gaussians where the rendering quality of 2DGS is inadequate, creating a mixed 2D-3D Gaussian representation. These 2D-3D Gaussians can then be animated using FLAME parameters. We further introduce a progressive training strategy that first trains the 2D Gaussians and then fine-tunes the mixed 2D-3D Gaussians. We demonstrate the superiority of MixedGaussianAvatar through comprehensive experiments.
